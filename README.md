# House-Price-Prediction-Ridge-Lasso
> A US-based housing company named Surprise Housing has decided to enter the Australian market. The company uses data analytics to purchase houses at a price below their actual values and flip them on at a higher price. For the same purpose, the company has collected a data set from the sale of houses in Australia. The data is provided in the CSV file below.

The company is looking at prospective properties to buy to enter the market. You are required to build a regression model using regularisation in order to predict the actual value of the prospective properties and decide whether to invest in them or not.

## General Information
- A ML Model is required to predict sales price of house.
- The Model was build using simple linear regression, and was further tuned using ridge and lasso regression
- It is expected to build a ML Model which predicts the Sales price of House
- The Dataset for Housing metrics was used in this project

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- R2 Value of Train and Test dataset for Ridge and Lasso is approximately 0.89 and 0.86
- There is a decrese in RSME Score in Lasso regression
